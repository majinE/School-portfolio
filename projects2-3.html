  <h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
  <p><h3>The gun control debate is a popular modern controversial topic, circulating throughout our country’s politics.  Statistics and research used for both sides of the controversy made it slightly difficult to choose a political side on the issue.  There seems to be unmistakable evidence that establishing more laws regulating gun ownership and market results in pros and cons.  Strangely enough, the recent government release on the classified “JFK files” are what has set my opinion on the matter.  I’m curious on whether evidence clearly stating that government agencies have developed plans to terrorize their own people, lie, and point to and blame others for the responsibility, can decimate the liberal claim that the citizens should fully depend on government for protection.  It opens questions to whether the Federal Government still abide to their purpose set by the preamble; establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, and provide for the common defense.  Our government has created plans to torment their people through violent means; should Americans give up their only right that allows citizens to rebel against their government if they begin to tyrannize the people?
