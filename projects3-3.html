      <p><h2><b>Failure to Enforce by Law Enforcement.</b></h2></p>
	<p><h3>The huge gap in the ratio shown by statistics is mainly due to law enforcement’s decision to not impose gun laws. When new laws are introduced, government and public officials are shown not to enforce them enough to see a decrease in gun crimes.  This is especially seen in towns and cities that share a conservative agenda. It is also important to note that conservatives believe that the 2nd Amendment provides citizens with the right to own firearms for personal protection if they wish to do so (LAX Ammunition). Lois Beckett of The Guardian, claimed that millions of dollars were spent trying to pass laws that would demand criminal background checks on every firearm sale, public or private, in the states of Colorado and Washington.  She later mentions that, “researchers concluded that the new laws had little measurable effect, probably because… there was a lack of enforcement by authorities.”  Police and Sheriff departments in rural conservative towns repeatedly indicated that they would not participate in the newly established laws, and bigger cities claimed they would label them as low priority (Beckett).  The major problem with gun violence that America faces is not guns; it is the lack of enforcement that occurs throughout the states.  Criminals who deliberately break federal laws should be prosecuted respectively.
  </h3></p>
  <p><h2><b>Background Checks</b></h2></p>
	<p><h3>Background checks have proven repeatedly that they can significantly reduce firearm violence.  A research paper conducted by Stuart et al., using statistics from the University of California Berkley, Center for Gun Policy and Research and more, compares a state’s gun statistics before and after background checks were implemented. In 1995, the state of Connecticut encouraged a law that required all gun buyers to take a test, essentially a background check, to receive a purchasing permit.  This resulted in a decrease of 40% of the state’s gun crime and 15% fewer rate of suicide (Stuart et al., 19). In contrast, research was conducted by Daniel Webster et al., on the state of Missouri which had decimated its law requiring the ownership of a permit to acquire a weapon in 2007.  Missouri’s homicide rate spiked by 23% and its gun related suicides increased by 16% (Webster et al., 19). A certain question comes in mind when reviewing this data; what about the data of all other states? In several states, background checks had virtually no positive or negative effects on crime rate. This inconsistency and lack of statistics is due to the federal government’s failure to provide adequate funds for decent studies (Kurtzleben).  Overtime, this can lead to the biased problems we experience today. Democrats don’t have sufficient evidence to support their agenda, often losing seats and money, while Republicans use the lack of data in their favor to counter more laws because they are deemed unviable.
  </h3></p>
  <p><h2><b>Counterargument</b></h2></p>
  <p><h3>Republicans are routinely met with backlash over their opposition on increasing gun control.  As mentioned by Harry Cheadle of Vice, close to 80% of voting Americans support more and improved gun laws to help seize violence in the country. Expanding background checks and enforcing them throughout every state would stop violent criminal offenders, the mentally ill, and domestic abusers from purchasing firearms (Cheadle). More specifically, Cheadle is speaking on all the modern mass shooting tragedies that have happened in recent times. Sandy Hooks School Shooting, Las Vegas Massacre, and the more recent Church shooting that occurred at a Texas Baptist Church, are all gun related tragedies that could have virtually been prevented. Conservatives would most likely challenge this claim by providing supporting evidence that many of these mass murders passed their background checks, and many of them because government agencies had not updated their criminal databases (Kestler-D’Amours). Advocates for gun control keep reverting to one key point; lofty standards for prosecution.  In the article, “Why even the gun laws that exist don’t always get enforced,” Sarah Trumble, Senior Policy Counselor during Barrack Obama’s presidency, is quoted as saying:
It is true that gun laws are vastly under-enforced, but the reason that they're under-enforced is not because the administration or law enforcement has failed: It's because they're written in a way that makes them impossible to enforce – intentionally. They're too vague to prosecute, the standards are too high to meet, the penalties are too low to be a deterrent and there's too little evidence to prosecute.
This reasoning can be used to explain data I presented by the Americans for Gun Safety Foundation; the prosecutions required to decrease black market gun trafficking and gun violence are near to impossible to achieve.
