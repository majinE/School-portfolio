      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Project 3: GUN CONTROL: BAN ALL FIREARMS? </h1>
      <p><h2><b>Counterargument</b></h2></p>
	<p><h3>A firearm ban in the United States is often mentioned, though subliminally and not directly, by liberal political figures. Countries like the United Kingdom and Australia have banned most firearms, so why won’t America? This specific action against guns has showed significant signs of success against firearm violence and decreasing their illegal circulation for both of those countries.  Information located in the online source, “U.S. Gun Policy: Global Comparisons,” by Jonathan Master, illustrates the recent decisions that the country of Australia executed due to the Port Arthur massacre of 1996.  A few weeks after the attack, Australia created the National Agreement on Firearms, that prohibited any personal ownership of automatic and semiautomatic rifles, but not restricting uses for hunting sports and farming (Masters). The country also instated a government mandated program to purchase back any weapons from the public, which impressively declined gun death rates. As stated by Masters, “the 650,000 assault weapons [bought] out of public circulation … effectively [decreased] the absence of gun-related mass killings in Australia since 1996.”  Surely right, the statistics provide credible evidence to support extreme gun control to limit gun related violence and illegal gun trafficking, but the same results are highly unlikely to result if similar nationwide laws were enacted in the United States for an assortment of reasons. We do not fall under the same circumstances as the U.K. or Australia.
  </h3></p>
  <p><h2><b>Buyback Programs Too Costly for US</b></h2><p>
	<p><h3>Not so much of a counter, but more of a hypothetical question: what would be different today, if we had banned firearms a long time ago? Paul Waldman’s excerpt, “Ban Guns” goes into a slight rage, questioning why Democratic Politicians don’t question the interpretation of the 2nd Amendment by the Supreme Court and restrain themselves from explicitly claiming they wish to ban guns. As a democrat himself, he acknowledges the complications that derive from trying to ban all guns, but it does not limit him from wondering what difficulties wouldn’t be present in the United States had a gun ban taken place long before. Waldman speaks to gun advocates saying, “no matter how trustworthy you might be, you have to reckon with the price [Americans] pay for the thing you enjoy: Over 30,000 Americans dead every year.” I agree with Waldman on this statement; no matter how many law abiding citizens there are, there will always be people who commit crime because they can get ahold of those types of weapons. Waldman then goes on to say that many advocates claim that firearms are necessary or desired for personal protection in home and business invasions. In response to this popular argument, Waldman agrees that a person would not be able to quickly defend themselves via firearms if guns were banned, but the invader would also be restricted from quickly committing gun violence as they would have an extremely scarce opportunity to obtain a firearm. Although I disagree with much that Waldman says, I fully endorse his conclusion that without the early presence of firearms, there would be little gun crime in our country. This case point becomes specifically relevant when looking at the recent wave of mass murder committed by people with gun in the United States. Had guns been banned or strictly sanctioned long ago, we would not have to see the terrible headlines like the ones listed at the beginning of this document.
  </h3></p>
  <p><h2><b>It's a Fair Constitutional Right and it Reduces Violence</b></h2><p>
  <p><h3>When established, the United States Constitution consisted of 10 amendments called the Bill of Rights. Noteworthy during any gun control debate, the 2nd amendment reads: A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. Several discussions emerge from how literal this amendment should be taken, and whether it allows for private ownership of firearms. As mentioned before, Democrats favor liberal views on gun control. They claim that the government’s sole responsibility is to protect their people often opposing the conservative view which declares that Citizens contain the right to private ownership of a firearm if they’d like because the 2nd amendment provides such right (LAX). Though I acknowledge that firearms are the root to several problems America faces today, I strongly insist that banning guns altogether is unlawful and attempts to infringe on the right for citizens to have ownership of firearms. The 2nd amendment was specifically created to combat tyranny from our centralized government; for government officials to try and dismantle such right is self-contradictory, but to campaign on having our government be our sole providers and protectors is ridiculous considering the numerous times they have abused their powers against American citizens.
  </h3></p>
  <p><h2><b>Right to Bear Arms</b></h2></p>
  <p><h3>The Heritage Guide to The Constitution, or HGC for short, states that the right to bear arms was ratified along with the United States Constitution on December 15, 1971. The decision to provide the states and citizens with the right to a militia comes from the fear of early acclaimed Americans to the inclination of military tyranny commanded by central governments (HGC). It’s important to note that the second amendment does not provide immunity from gun provisions; several federal laws have already been enacted to suppress gun violence. Many liberals, including author and self-pronounced Democrat Paul Waldman, further challenge the current interpretation of the 2nd amendment, claiming that it does not provide the right for private ownership of weapons. As the H.G.C states, “the government might be restricted to using a militia, consisting of ordinary civilians who supply their own weapons.” If the right to bear arms does not mean the right to private gun ownership, how else would a state militia be supplied to protect its state from governmental abuse? This interpretation to the Bill of Rights’ 2nd amendment is a clear call of infringement on the rights of all United States Citizens.
