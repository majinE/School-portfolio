      <p><h2><center>Rough Draft/Outline</h2></p>
	<p><h3>Discourse communities define the identity of a human being through language, actions, and reactions that are exclusively gained from a form of training.  Every human is born into a primary discourse and can willingly be indoctrinated into any genre of secondary discourse.  They are the motives for the nature of our personality.  Linguist John Swales elaborates on six characteristics that produce the framework for the success of a discourse.  In his analysis, he claims that their feat derives from: common goals, communication, contributions, unique characteristics, possible changes in membership, and reasons to support the success of the coached discourses.  We often associate secondary discourses with the cause of our personalities, but the primary discourse influences our decisions in choosing and participating in a secondary discourse.  In my case, my family is my primary discourse, therefore it impacts my personality the most.</h3></p>
	<p><h3>“A discourse community has a broadly agreed set of common public goals.” (Swales) Usually these goals are agreed implicitly in primary discourses while secondary communities, like a job, classroom, or organization, tend to have written goals; resembled by rules and values they hope to carry out.    Swales states that these goals are public because non-members have the capability to join any form of discourse.   My primary discourse teaches younger members common goals such as supporting and helping one another, while the older members goals are customarily to try and keep the family together through thick and thin.  They are usually the ones in charge of passing down these goals and traditions in attempt to keep our discourse advancing throughout future generations.  Family members or friends can join and stay to sabotage our community or to help increase our advancement.</h3></p>
	<p><h3“A discourse community has mechanisms of intercommunication among its members.” (Swales) Successful discourses require a form of communications or various forms.  Present-day primary discourses, as do secondary discourses, incline to using electronic forms of communications.  Writing letters and using the postal service has evolved into instantaneous electronic mail.  Many Job discourses have converted into using skype and zoom business calls for interviews, meetings and more, instead of hosting these events in person.  Phone calls and group text messages has become the primary source of communication within my primary discourse.  This allows us to stay-up-to-date with any family business.  Though technology has been a changing factor within our family’s communication mechanisms, traditional family gatherings and events occur within our discourse.</p>
	<p><h3>“A discourse community uses it participatory mechanisms primarily to provide information and feedback.” (Swales) Being able to provide information to any discourse requires one’s contributions.  Swales uses an example revolved around subscription based discourses. If a person pays for a subscription with any newsletter or music streaming site and do not read or listen to the products being paid for, they have no authority to provide any type of feedback to the discourse.  I possess the authority to provide feedback to my family members because I contribute support, guidance, love, and knowledge to others.  My parents have the right to provide me with financial feedback and criticism because they contribute to my financial needs.  In contrast, my younger siblings don’t have the right to provide my parents with feedback over their business because they have not yet provided a sort of contribution.</h3></p>
	<p><h3>“A discourse community utilizes and hence possesses one or more genres in the communicative furtherance of its aims.” (Swales) Many discourse communities often ask members why they provide support within the community.  Responses range from “I provide support so the discourse can achieve its common community goals” to “I am just trying to fit in somewhere”.  My family’s support originates from the common community goals.  As described in the first characteristic of a discourse, we hope to provide each other with love and support through thick and thin.</h3></p>
	<p><h3>“In addition to owning genres, a discourse community has acquired some specific lexis.” (Swales) My primary discourse has a unique characteristic that tells us apart from just any genre of discourse.  We consist of small business owners and entrepreneur; we use this trait as a communication tool.  My family is also extremely religious, specifically, catholic members.  Although the religious trait can cause distortion between discourse members, usually between me and my parents, it provides many of the fundamentals that created our community goals.
