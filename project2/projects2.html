      <p><h2><center>Rough Draft/Outline</h2></p>
	<p><h3> Gun control is the broad term used as an explanation for any type of restriction on the manufacturing, selling, and purchasing of guns.  When the Bill of Rights were ratified back in 1791, the 2nd amendment was established that called for a well-regulated Militia, without any type of infringement on the right of keeping and bearing Arms.  Today, gun control continues to be one of the world’s significant controversial issues; sparking tense debates between advocates for and against the regulation of such weapons, and how much regulation is deemed constitutional.  There are several takes on this political issue, but two major political groups, the conservatives and the liberals, dominate the battlefield on the topic. The online article, Gun Control: Liberal vs. Conservative Beliefs, written by the LAX Ammunition, provide a simple yet effective comparison between the opinions of both groups; liberal opinions on gun control are usually favored by the Democratic Party, while the conservative opinions tend to coincide with the Republican Party.  Liberals argue that the government’s sole responsibility is to protect its civilians, providing no need for citizens to own guns for personal protection.  Conservatives strongly believe that people shouldn’t have to depend on the government for protection and that the 2nd amendment provides them with the right to have a gun for protection if they want to.

	<p><h3>This controversial topic is nothing new to American history as it dates to 1837, the earliest sign in American history where the gun control debate began. Timeline of Gun Control in the United States, by Robert Longley has several important dates that introduce us to the beginnings of the controversial topic.  In 1837, the state of Georgia attempted to pass a law banning all personal handguns.  The U.S. Supreme Court stepped in and deemed the law unconstitutional under the 2nd amendment, and the law was eventually dismantled.  In 1871, the first gun control laws were established in many southern states that revoked the 2nd amendment right from black peoples.  What is now known as “black codes”, were enforced which did not allow them to have any possession of firearms.  The National Rifle Association, which was founded in 1871, is an important event in American history as the advocacy group today has huge responsibility for the gun control debate that occurs in present America.  The organization came about to prepare American civilians for upcoming wars. (Longley, 2017)
