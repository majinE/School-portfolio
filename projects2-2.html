  <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
	<p><h3> Gun control is the broad term used as an explanation for any type of restriction on the manufacturing, selling, and purchasing of guns.  When the Bill of Rights were ratified back in 1791, the 2nd amendment was established that called for a well-regulated Militia, without any type of infringement on the right of keeping and bearing Arms.  Today, gun control continues to be one of the world’s significant controversial issues; sparking tense debates between advocates for and against the regulation of such weapons, and how much regulation is deemed constitutional.  There are several takes on this political issue, but two major political groups, the conservatives and the liberals, dominate the battlefield on the topic. The online article, Gun Control: Liberal vs. Conservative Beliefs, written by the LAX Ammunition, provide a simple yet effective comparison between the opinions of both groups; liberal opinions on gun control are usually favored by the Democratic Party, while the conservative opinions tend to coincide with the Republican Party.  Liberals argue that the government’s sole responsibility is to protect its civilians, providing no need for citizens to own guns for personal protection.  Conservatives strongly believe that people shouldn’t have to depend on the government for protection and that the 2nd amendment provides them with the right to have a gun for protection if they want to.

  <h2><b>History</b></h2>
	<p><h3>This controversial topic is nothing new to American history as it dates to 1837, the earliest sign in American history where the gun control debate began. Timeline of Gun Control in the United States, by Robert Longley has several important dates that introduce us to the beginnings of the controversial topic.  In 1837, the state of Georgia attempted to pass a law banning all personal handguns.  The U.S. Supreme Court stepped in and deemed the law unconstitutional under the 2nd amendment, and the law was eventually dismantled.  In 1871, the first gun control laws were established in many southern states that revoked the 2nd amendment right from black peoples.  What is now known as “black codes”, were enforced which did not allow them to have any possession of firearms.  The National Rifle Association, which was founded in 1871, is an important event in American history as the advocacy group today has huge responsibility for the gun control debate that occurs in present America.  The organization came about to prepare American civilians for upcoming wars. (Longley, 2017)

  <h2><b>Statistics</b></h2>
  <p><h3>The Brady Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence offers great statistics provided by Center for Disease Control and Prevention.  The CDC reports its data through its web-based statistics query.  According to the informative article, “Key Gun Violence Statistics”, on average, children and adolescents ages 0 through 19 are shot daily; either through murders, assaults, suicides and suicide attempts, or police intervention.  On average, 7 of those victims die, and 40 survive with major injuries (Brady).  When dealing with Americans of all ages, 315 people suffer from gun violence; 93 of which die from a casualty, and 222 people who suffer major injuries but survive (Brady).  On a yearly basis, an average of 114,994 people are shot in several types of scenarios; 33,880 people which die, and 81,114 people who survive the violent events (Brady).  A study summarized by Mark Gius states that from the year 1980 and 2009, the ban on assault weapons had no significant effect on murder rates at the state level.  The study goes on to claim that states with additional, “restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders” (Gius).  Many American Citizens feel that they need a gun for protection; opposing the liberal views on gun control, as they tend to believe the responsibility of the protection of citizens should be the Government’s issue.  A survey held by the Pew Research Center discovered that over 57% of Americans strongly believe that owning a firearm provides them with a safeguard from being victimized. They justify their belief by claiming that criminals will obtain a fear of retaliation from their victims who fight back with firearms (Pew).  Several states show astounding data on gun restrictions which were established to decrease gun violence.  In Washington D.C, right before the handgun ban and trigger-lock law was established in 1976, the average murder rate was about 27 murders for every 100,000 people (FBI). About 20 years later, the murder rate rose to nearly 83 murders and intentional manslaughters for every 100,000 people, and once the law was dismantled in 2008, murder rate fell to under 15 cases per 100,000 people (FBI).  Similar data was recorded for the states of Florida and Texas.  On October 1st, 1987, Florida established a right-to-carry law for various firearms (FBI).  Prior to the new law, Florida dealt with a violence rate of 12-15 murder per 100,000 people; after the law became effective, the murders per 100,000 annually decreased to an average of 5 victims (FBI).  Before a similar law was established in Texas in 1996, the state suffered from annual murder rate of 14-17 victims per 100,000 people; soon after, the law exponentially decreased the murder rate to an average of 4 crime cases (FBI).
