      <p><center><h1>Analysis of my Primary Discourse...Continued</h3></p>
	<p><h2>“In addition to owning genres, a discourse community has acquired some specific lexis.” (Swales 473) My primary discourse has a unique characteristic that tells us apart from just any genre of discourse.  We consist of small business owners and entrepreneurs; we use this trait as a communication tool.  My family is also extremely religious, specifically, catholic members.  Although the religious trait can cause distortion between discourse members, usually between me and my parents, it provides many of the fundamentals that created our community goals.</h2></p>
	<p><h2>“A discourse community has a threshold level of members with a suitable degree of relevant content and discoursal expertise.” (Swales 473) A family primary discourse has two levels of memberships: the ‘wise’ adults, and the younger apprentices(children/adolescents).  The adults hold a higher title within the community, meaning they have the responsibility of making sure the younger apprentices learn the same fundamental common goals of the discourse.  The apprentices have the decision of not participating to advance the discourse, but they will always be apart of the discourse through blood; that is unless their goal is the downfall of the community.  Children of the adults are not the only apprentices in the discourse.  For example, when an adult in a family discourse finds a significant other and introduces them to the discourse, the significant other becomes an apprentice with the hopes of indoctrinating into the family community.  Non-blood relatives can also lose their position in the discourse if an unfortunate divorce occurs, and they choose to disregard the community.  A final example of a loss in the family discourse membership, is any form of death.</h3></p>
	<p><h2>Author James Paul Gee describes a discourse as an ‘identity kit’ which comes with a set of instructions on how to be a certain type of person (7).  It contains a laid-out plan, with ways to speak, act, and sometimes think, on which the discourse members learn from.  In my case, my primary discourse, which is my family, has shaped the person I am by providing me with a blueprint on how I should act, speak, and think accordingly to the discourse’s genre.  The most prominent characteristics I have received from the discourse is my social behavior, the strong will not to get influenced by others’ ideas, and the ability to quickly facilitate any sense of frustration against any issue or a person.</h2></p>
  <p><h2>I credit my family community for my social behavior because they are the only discourse that has had a substantial impact on this specific trait.  From the point I was old enough to make ethical self-decisions, my family provided me with a set of rules to learn and pursue, that taught me the discourse’s style on how to socially interact.  As the apprentice, I followed these newly established rules; I began providing wiser humans with respect and listened to their ideas without immediately refuting them.  Simple human decencies, like opening the doors for others or letting others speak without any kind of interruption, are a few of the many traits my discourse possesses, as should all in my opinion.</h2></p>
