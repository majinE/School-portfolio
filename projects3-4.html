      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Project 3: GUN CONTROL: BAN ALL FIREARMS? </h1>
      <p><h2><b>Unviable Decision to Ban or Destroy All Guns in the U.S.</b></h2></p>
	<p><h3>A firearm ban in the United States is often mentioned, though subliminally and not directly, by liberal political figures. Countries like the United Kingdom and Australia have banned most firearms, so why won’t America? This specific action against guns has showed significant signs of success against firearm violence and decreasing their illegal circulation for both of those countries.  Information located in the online source, “U.S. Gun Policy: Global Comparisons,” by Jonathan Master, illustrates the recent decisions that the country of Australia executed due to the Port Arthur massacre of 1996.  A few weeks after the attack, Australia created the National Agreement on Firearms, that prohibited any personal ownership of automatic and semiautomatic rifles, but not restricting uses for hunting sports and farming (Masters). The country also instated a government mandated program to purchase back any weapons from the public, which impressively declined gun death rates. As stated by Masters, “the 650,000 assault weapons [bought] out of public circulation … effectively [decreased] the absence of gun-related mass killings in Australia since 1996.”  Surely right, the statistics provide credible evidence to support extreme gun control to limit gun related violence and illegal gun trafficking, but the same results are highly unlikely to result if similar nationwide laws were enacted in the United States for an assortment of reasons. We do not fall under the same circumstances as the U.K. or Australia.
  </h3></p>
  <p><h2><b>Buyback Programs Too Costly for US</b></h2><p>
	<p><h3>As mentioned before, several countries and states have enforced some type of gun buyback program to reduce violence and crime. Countries including Argentina, Brazil, and Australia have all created unique ways to promote a successful buyback policy.  As stated by David Lenis et al., “In July 2007 Argentina initiated a national gun buyback program that … was voluntary and anonymous.” The anonymity of the program along with a small compensation encouraged several people to return illegal firearms as they would not be prosecuted or charged under any crime. The country was able to obtain roughly 104,000 firearms; about 7 percent of the country’s total firearms (Lenis et al,). Similarly, Brazil, being the world’s 5th most populous country at an occupancy of 207,353,391 people according to the Census.gov, created two buyback programs in 2003 and 2009 (New York Times). “The Brazilian Government collected and destroyed over 1.1 million guns,” of its estimated 17 million, through a $3 million budget; as Lenis said, “the buyback program[s] implemented in Brazil has contributed to the observed reduction in firearm related mortality” (BBC News; New York Times). It’s impossible to challenge such statistics and studies mentioned by the authors, but would be extremely misleading to use in favor of funding a national gun buyback program in the United States.  The United States stands at third most populated country, with an occupancy of 326,625,791 people, and a total gun count of over 320 million (Census; Horsley). Support from proponents of stricter gun control often disregard these crucial details, misleading many to believe inaccurate information.
  </h3></p>
  <p><h3>As mentioned before, Australia’s, Argentina’s, and Brazil’s buyback programs worked exceptionally well to limit gun crimes committed in each country. Each program was executed and funded differently, resulting in unique economic statistics. To provide the most accurate estimates possible, I’ll be using Australia’s national program’s economical cost and Guns Per Capita, capita equaling per every 100 individuals in this case, to simulate the cost that the United States would have to bear if they ratified similar gun control changes.  Referencing Adelaide Now’s statistics; the country of Australia has an estimated 24.1 Guns Per Capita, coming out to an estimate of 5.78 million illegal and legal guns in the country. The 1996 buyback program recovered roughly 650,000 firearms, or around 11% of the current total in the Australia. As the Australian National Audit states, “the Commonwealth funded the scheme through a on-off 0.2 per cent increase [from 1.5%] in the Medicare levy to raise about $500 million.” That being said, the country funded their program by raising taxes used to cover medical costs.  This information is vital economic data as you can receive the average price per gun that Australia paid. Through the gun buyback program, Australia had to pay an average of 770 AUD (Australian Dollar(s)) per firearm recovered. At the current market, a single AUD is worth 0.75 U.S. Dollars. Recovering 11% of the total estimated firearms in the U.S. would amount to approximately 35.2 million weapons. Using the same average Australia had to pay per gun, the U.S. would have to pay out nearly 20.3 billion dollars for 11% of privately owned guns, or 184.8 billion US dollars to eradicate all firearms in the country. That is, if pro-gun Americans are willing to sell their weapons for $577 apiece when they have purchased them for 2-3 times that price. This data is estimated and only showcases why it would not be feasible for the United States to enforce buyback programs.
  </h3></p>
  <p><h2><b>Some U.S. States Have Already Attempted Buyback Programs</b></h2></p>
  <p><h3>It is evident that a national buyback program for the United States is economically non-practical to achieve as according to my estimated data. Nevertheless, it becomes reasonable to question whether individual state funded gun buyback programs would be viable. In fact, several programs have already been publicly or privately hosted in throughout many states. The first record of a gun buyback program comes from a 1976 newspaper article titled, “Guns of Baltimore: Why Did Bounty Stop?” by Robert Parry. The program paid a $50, about $217 spending power today, bounty for every gun turned in, and collected approximately 13,500 weapons (Parry). However, Parry then continues saying, “the operation People Against Senseless Shootings… was supposed to have reduced the number of gun related crimes. Instead, crimes went up during the life of the program.” This program was soon met with a halt and deemed unsuccessful. A church in Detroit, Michigan also hosted a similar operation funded by church-goers. According to Detroit CBS Local News, “church members raised more than $18,000 to support the buyback program,” which resulted in a collection of 365 weapons by the Detroit police. The news channel then continues saying that the operation sparked a protest by gun activists, as they began offering participants more to not turn in their weapons. Several of the protesters were noted saying that they strongly believed gun buyback programs were unsuccessful (CBS Detroit). One of the most controversial program that was initiated took place in Seattle, Washington in 2013. The operation itself can be labeled successful, rendering 712 weapons through $68,000 worth of donated gift cards, according to Seattle.gov. However, Perry Chiaramonte reported on the unexpected bazaar that was influenced by the event. Chiaramonte states that, “with private transactions not prevented by federal law, and in many cases not by state law, guns continued to change hands, much to the chagrin of officials.” Enforcement was hoping to get guns of the market, but instead stood and watched as several weapons were legally traded without having to undergo background checks. As labeled by Dan Horn of the Cincinnati Enquirer, one of the biggest issue seen throughout gun buyback programs is the tendency for Citizens to turn in insignificant items, such as malfunctioning and rusty-old firearms, as compared to the arsenal that causes majority of the country’s firearm crimes. Horn then introduces Makarios, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, who states that “more stringent gun laws that limit access to certain weapons or require background checks are slightly more effective in reducing violence than gun buybacks.” This claim helps support my argument by showing why enforcement of background checks should be priority over programs that have no significant effect in combating firearm violence.
