      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Project 3: GUN CONTROL: BAN ALL FIREARMS? </h1>
      <p><h2><b>Introduction</b></h2></p>
	<p><h3>“TX Attorney Gen: At Least 25, Up To 27 People Killed in Texas Church Shooting,” (Fox News) and “The Las Vegas attack is the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history,” (CNN) are recent horrifying news headlines that have flashed on the television and phone screens of almost all Americans. During these times of pain and sorrow in our country, the debate on gun control revamps itself with new and stronger evidence on both sides of the political spectrum. Majority of Democrats bring up points on how problematic guns are, while Republicans defend Americans’ 2nd Amendment. Most importantly, a single question, often subliminal, is reintroduced every time a national tragedy like mass murder occurs: Should all firearms be banned in hopes of decreasing gun related violence in America? Several vital factors must be acknowledged before voting citizens make an educated decision. In my opinion, they should not be banned.  Stripping American citizens of their second amendment right would be economically substantial, and is not a viable option when government agencies themselves are not enforcing and pursing the law. The 2nd amendment should be a legal right for every American citizen, and no interpretation should have the ability to belittle such entitlement.
  </h3></p>
  <p><h2><b>Non-Enforced Laws and Lack of Prosecution.</b></h2><p>
	<p><h3>As the online article, “Gun Control: Liberal vs. Conservative Beliefs,” by the LAX Ammunition states, the Liberal political agenda on gun control is based on expanding firearm laws and regulations, or an outright ban of all gun related weapons to protect communities from gun violence. They claim that the 2nd Amendment does not provide individuals the right to own firearms, and only allows for states to create and fund a militia to protect citizens from a corrupt government (LAX Ammunition). These views are usually favored throughout the Democratic community. A huge problem the United States faces is the lack of enforcement by government and public officials on already existing gun laws. </h3></p>
  <p><h3>A study of Federal Gun Prosecutions conducted by the Americans for Gun Safety Foundation unraveled shocking information. Criminal background checks were mandated for all firearm purchases from licensed sellers through the Brady Gun Law of 1993 (ATF), making criminals search for other means of acquiring such weapons. The study found that 89% of the guns used for violent measures from 2000 to 2002, had been guns that had been circulated through different owners at least once, with 34% of those weapons being sold within three years from a licensed retailer (AGSF). From 1.1 million violent crimes from through 2000 to 2003, about one-third of the crimes showed signs of trafficked firearms. Of these 300 thousand cases of firearm violence, only 515 total cases were filed under the five major laws created to combat gun trafficking; the following laws were being virtually ignored (AGSF):

922(a)(1)(A) and 924(n) of Title 18 US Code are the “two most straight forward trafficking offenses,” according to ATF.20 922(a)(1)(A) prohibits any individual from engaging in the business of selling firearms unless that individual has a federal firearms license. 924(n) bars anyone from crossing state lines to purchase a firearm with the intent to resell. ATF states that “when these two offenses are not available, alternative charges are brought,”21 which include 922(d), 924(g), and 924(h), as well as several other statutes that are covered in other parts of this report pertaining to stolen guns, obliterated serial numbers, and the sale of firearms to minors. 922(d) prohibits any individual from selling a firearm to a person whom they know or have reason to know is a criminal or other prohibited buyer. 922(d) is the main statute used to prevent straw purchasing – buying a firearm from a licensed dealer with the intention of selling or giving that gun to a prohibited person. 924(g) and 924(h) prohibit the sale or transfer of a firearm to a drug dealer or to an individual whom the seller or transferor should have reason to know will commit a crime. This statute requires the person selling or transferring the firearm to know the state of mind of the buyer.
In 1999, President Clinton, affiliated with the democratic party, demanded the Departments of Justice and Treasury to provide an increased amount of resources to help aid in the investigation and prosecution of the violations committed under United States’ federal gun laws (AGSF). Comparing the ratio of crime to prosecution from that timeline, we can see that there was an enormous difference that failed to be addressed by government officials.
