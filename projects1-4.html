      <p><center><h1>Analysis of my Primary Discourse...Continued</h3></p>
	<p><h2>The primary discourse has given me the skill to think for myself and not follow what other people believe or say without evidence to back up their claims.  When dealing with public thoughts or the ideas of the people in a community outside of mine, this skill becomes a positive trait.  When they attempt to convince me on notions based on feelings, that are factually untrue, I ignore them and stick to the facts; even if I share the same feelings on the subject.  On the other hand, when dealing with religious conversations within my family, this attribute causes tension between myself and the primary discourse.  As you can infer, I am an atheist; refuting most religious arguments simply because they lack my definition of factual evidence and bases its fundamentals on ‘faith’.  Around the age of 14, I flipped my views on the Catholic religion’s creationist beliefs.  I terminated my membership within my family’s religious discourse, and joined a ‘but science’ based discourse. My mother in specific, is the person who challenges my discourse community the most.  In these situations, two of the traits I follow from my primary discourse set into play.  I perform the first main trait, by sitting and listening to the religious ideas my mom shares without any interruption, and politely respond with what my discourse thinks.  I also refute any ideas that are not true, while also acknowledging the positives that religion has set forward for all human society.
  </h2></p>
	<p><h2>My ability to quickly get over any type of frustration must be the most prominent trait I received from my family community as an apprentice.  This characteristic serves positively in generally all situations I face.  In school, students often acquire frustration from the amount of work that is received from their professors.  In several jobs, workers occasionally interact with terrible customers.  With relationships, humans often deal with frustration by spewing out ignorant comments, or performing actions, like cheating, they later regret once they’re over their frustration.  Some humans are even capable of holding a grudge against certain people for an extensive duration of time.  By keeping the trait of quickly filtering any form of irritation against another person, I have gained a safeguard that can prevent several consequences that originates from similar situations.</h3></p>
	<p><h2>
	I share the same opinion as Gee over a discourse being the identity kit of an individual.  A human’s entire personality is developed from their primary discourse, and influenced by any secondary discourse they are members of.  The reason I emphasized on my personality traits derived from my family community is to raise awareness that any person is extremely predictable.  If you analyze a person’s primary discourse community, there is a probable chance you can use the inherited characteristics to fully understand them.  It could provide an answer to many of the world’s problems including: political violence, ethical issues, criminality, or even two people who just want to get to know each-other slightly more.  We all possess negative characteristics that have been passed down throughout discourse generations.  It is possible that by analyzing the motive for the negative traits, we could eradicate them and set common goals for the advancement of all humanity.  After all, we are all part of the human discourse
