      <p><h2><b>Government Abuse</b></h2></p>
	<p><h3>The main establishment for the right to bear arms was for the protection against an oppressive government (HCG). Over the course of American history, our government has been documented disrespecting its citizens. McCarthyism is an important event in American history that shows the type of government power that can is often abused; negatively affecting its citizens. According to Paul J. Achter, Senator Joseph McCarthy ordered a vast amount of investigations to expose communist infiltration in the U.S. government through arbitrary allegations, causing defamation of reputation of hundreds of Americans. His accusations failed to make any reasonable charges against anyone, but they prompted many to lose their jobs or receive condemnation from the public (Achter). Another popular series of operations that shows why we need rights to rebel against a tyrant government, is the CIA’s Projects MKUltra. Kat Eschner of the Smithsonian Magazine, states that, “the project was originally intended to make sure the United States government kept up with presumed Soviet advances in mind-controlling technology.” Started as voluntary projects, MKUltra soon began secretly and illegally injecting drugs on humans to study how it chemically altered human behavior (Eschner). Started in 1953 and ultimately being halted in 1973, MKUltra consisted of several projects funded indirectly by the CIA, that gathered the effects of drugs like LSD, heroin, and morphine on thousands of unwilling Americans (Eschner). I’d say this is unmistakable evidence to prove my point; we should never grant full trust into an organization that has proven several times to lash out against its own people.

  <p><h2><b> Counterargument </b></h2><p>
	<p><h3>The Constitution and many of its early amendments are often regarded as outdated excerpts that should be adjusted in accordance to the technological advancement of current day America. David S. Cohen of the Rolling Stones explains how several older amendments, which have long been repealed, allowed for laws and ‘rights’ that would be outlandish and petrifying for the present social standards of the United States. In his article, “Why It’s Time to Repeal the Second Amendment” Cohen claims that:
The Second Amendment needs to be repealed because it is outdated, a threat to liberty and a suicide pact. When the Second Amendment was adopted in 1791, there were no weapons remotely like the AR-15 assault rifle and many of the advances of modern weaponry were long from being invented or popularized. Sure, the Founders knew that the world evolved and that technology changed, but the weapons of today that are easily accessible are vastly different than anything that existed in 1791. When the Second Amendment was written, the Founders didn't have to weigh the risks of one man killing 49 and injuring 53 all by himself. Now we do, and the risk-benefit analysis of 1791 is flatly irrelevant to the risk-benefit analysis of today.
Speaking on behalf of the victims of the horrifying mass murder that took place a few months ago in Las Vegas, Nevada, his statement provides a clear explanation as to why many oppose the current interpretation of the 2nd amendment. We are currently 214 years ahead of the day the founding fathers wrote the Constitution, and it is almost certain they had no vision of the advanced firearms we are used to seeing today. A second predicament that Cohen explains is that gun advocates claim that repealing the 2nd amendment would be a violation of their basic rights. He counters this by asking whether the right to liberty is only a one-way street. Cohen expresses his concern over the recent mass shootings; questioning whether the victims had a right to enjoy themselves at a nightclub, a Las Vegas concert, and even simply attending school. These are all places that suffered major tragedies involving firearm savagery.
  </h3></p>
  <p><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><p>
  <p><h3>I continue to strongly believe that the 2nd amendment provides citizens the right to private ownership of most firearms. I do not subject to a complete ban of all firearms in country, simply because it would devour resources that our country does not even have, in aims to take away guns from everyone, including law-abiding natives. Instead, I strongly support logical gun control: reinforced background checks and prosecutions of retailers and buyers who break federal gun laws should be funded to a greater extent. Non-cooperative law enforcement is also to blame for the gun violence America has today. They should be obligated to enforce laws whether it goes against their political beliefs. The greatest affect I see this political gun debate having on my Primary Discourse is as follows: criminals would have no deterrence to assault my business owning family. My parents have been held to gun point a few times, only to steal a few hundred dollars out of the cash-register and cause great distress to them. If tomorrow the United States decided to ban all firearms, there would be a high possibility that criminals would not turn in their weapons. Crime could increase especially throughout businesses that would have to discard any weapons for self-defense use. I’m for logical and plausible gun control; but citizens should not be stripped from their right to own a firearm.
