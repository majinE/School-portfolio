      <p><center><h2>Overall Reflection .</h2></p>
      <p><h2>This by far has to be my favorite English class I’ve ever taken. In High School, we had no decision over choosing a certain topic that interested us to write about. It was always “here’s the topic, and here’s sources you can use to backup your claim. Now go.” This entire class was seemed well constructed, and everyday was meaningful.</h2></p>
      <p><h2>This first project was quite interesting as I had never really questioned why I was who I am. After being introduced to the term “Discourse Community” I was able to make connections between my history line and how the way a Family Discourse will always has an impact on a person’s personality in all instances. For example, my mother’s family has always been religious; her parenting skills were passed down through generations of religious morals and beliefs. Although I have pushed myself as far as possible form religion, I strongly believe many of my personal morals derive from her parenting skills. I can relate to Jimmy Baca’s experience with his Primary Discourse, as hard as he tried to push himself away from it, the discourse always has some sort of impact on his life. This project also allowed me to search slightly deeper into what my family history which is something I had not done before.
</h2></p>
      <p><h2>Project 2 came as a surprise to me; not because of the difficulty of the work, but because I researched several aspects of gun control that I was not familiar with. I had no knowledge to have an educated opinion on the topic. After summarizing several sources, I was able to determine why several politicians said different statistics and what they meant. To my surprise, I found a number data that shifted my opinion on gun control; it showed the hypocrisy from both sides of the political debate on gun control. Most of it had to do with gun violence statistics, more specifically, crime to gun ratio in accordance to all countries around the world. Data was usually skewed to provide false explanations on why a gun ban is plausible. Nevertheless, the project expanded my skills on researching information other than mainstream news sources. I found myself often looking through online PDF files and making sure the information I was about to use was not in any way skewed or biased. Overall, I had a great time researching data and summarizing for this project.
      </h2></p>
      <p><h2>Project 3 has been the most difficult paper I have had to write so far in my life. The required amount of writing was what I expected from a college course, but the amount of biased sources I had to work with was extremely challenging. I would find sources contradicting each other left and right; conservative blogs attacking liberal blogs and vice-versa on why one another was incorrect. I found myself using my own knowledge to make an estimate on the cost of some gun control law that Democrats have proposed. I discovered that my skills continued to expand; It was becoming easier to pinpoint all the information that was biased, skewed, or incorrect using several resources to validate my predictions. Making the website is by far the best part of the project. Incorporating some type of Computer Science into this project made it even easier to enjoy as it eased the headaches I would get from finding useful sources.</h2></p>
      <p><h2>I enjoyed Professor Kelly Medina-Lopez teaching style. As many of my cohort members shared, her class was one of the best English class any of us have taken. Each project helped improve our english skills and no class was a waste of time. </h2></p>
