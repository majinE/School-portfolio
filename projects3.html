      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Project 3: GUN CONTROL: BAN ALL FIREARMS? </h1>
      <p><h2><center>Rough Draft/Outline</h2></p>
	<p><h3> “TX Attorney Gen: At Least 25, Up To 27 People Killed in Texas Church Shooting,” (Fox News) and “The Las Vegas attack is the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history,” (CNN) are recent horrifying news headlines that have flashed on the television and phone screens of almost all Americans. During these times of pain and sorrow in our country, the debate on gun control revamps itself with new and stronger evidence on both sides of the political spectrum. Majority of Democrats bring up points on how problematic guns are, while Republicans defend Americans’ 2nd Amendment. Most importantly, a single question, often subliminal, is reintroduced every time a national tragedy like mass murder occurs; Should all firearms be banned in hopes of decreasing gun related violence in America? Several vital factors must be acknowledged before voting citizens make an educated decision. In my opinion, no.  Stripping American citizens of their second amendment right is not a viable option when government agencies themselves are not enforcing and pursing the law. Firearms offer protection; dismantling Americans of their guns will only escalate violence created by them.
  </h3>As the online article, “Gun Control: Liberal vs. Conservative Beliefs,” by the LAX Ammunition states, the Liberal political agenda on gun control is based on expanding firearm laws and regulations, or an outright ban of all gun related weapons to protect communities from gun violence. They claim that the 2nd Amendment does not provide people the right to own firearms, and only allows for states to create and fund a militia to protect citizens from a corrupt government (LAX Ammunition). These views are usually favored throughout the Democratic community. A huge problem the United States faces is the lack of enforcement by government and public officials on already existing gun laws.
A study of Federal Gun Prosecutions conducted by the Americans for Gun Safety Foundation unraveled shocking information. Criminal background checks were mandated for all firearm purchases from licensed sellers through the Brady Gun Law of 1993 (ATF), making criminals search for other means of acquiring such weapons. The study found that 89% of the guns used for violent measures from 2000 to 2002, had been guns that’d been circulated through different owners at least once, with 34% of those weapons being sold within three years from a licensed retailer (AGSF). From 1.1 million violent crimes committed through 2000 to 2003, about one-third of the crimes showed signs of trafficked firearms. Of these 300 thousand cases of firearm violence, only 515 total cases were filed under the five major laws created to combat gun trafficking; the following laws were being virtually ignored (AGSF):

922(a)(1)(A) and 924(n) of Title 18 US Code are the “two most straight forward trafficking offenses,” according to ATF.20 922(a)(1)(A) prohibits any individual from engaging in the business of selling firearms unless that individual has a federal firearms license. 924(n) bars anyone from crossing state lines to purchase a firearm with the intent to resell. ATF states that “when these two offenses are not available, alternative charges are brought,”21 which include 922(d), 924(g), and 924(h), as well as several other statutes that are covered in other parts of this report pertaining to stolen guns, obliterated serial numbers, and the sale of firearms to minors. 922(d) prohibits any individual from selling a firearm to a person whom they know or have reason to know is a criminal or other prohibited buyer. 922(d) is the main statute used to prevent straw purchasing – buying a firearm from a licensed dealer with the intention of selling or giving that gun to a prohibited person. 924(g) and 924(h) prohibit the sale or transfer of a firearm to a drug dealer or to an individual whom the seller or transferor should have reason to know will commit a crime. This statute requires the person selling or transferring the firearm to know the state of mind of the buyer.
In 1999, President Clinton, affiliated with the democratic party, demanded the Departments of Justice and Treasury to provide an increased amount of resources to help aid with the investigation and prosecution of the violations committed under United States’ federal gun laws (AGSF). Comparing the ratio of crime to prosecution from that timeline, we can see that there was an enormous difference that failed to be addressed by government officials.
	The huge gap between the ratio shown by statistics is mainly due to law enforcement’s decision to not impose gun laws. When new laws are introduced, government and public officials are shown not to enforce them enough to see a decrease in gun crimes.  This is especially seen in towns and cities that share a conservative agenda. Important to note, conservatives believe that the 2nd Amendment provides citizens with the right to own firearms for personal protection if they wish to do so (LAX Ammunition). Lois Beckett of The Guardian, claimed that millions of dollars were spent trying to pass laws that would demand criminal background checks on every firearm sale, public or private, in the states of Colorado and Washington.  She later mentions that, “researchers concluded that the new laws had little measurable effect, probably because… there was a lack of enforcement by authorities.”  Police and Sherriff departments in rural conservative towns repeatedly indicated that they would not participate in the newly established laws, and bigger cities claimed they would label them as low priority (Beckett).  The major problem with gun violence that America faces is not guns; it is the lack of enforcement that occurs throughout the states.  Criminals who deliberately break federal laws should be prosecuted respectively.
	Background checks have proven repetitively that they can significantly reduce firearm violence.  A research paper conducted by Stuart et al., using statistics from the University of California Berkley, Center for Gun Policy and Research and more, compares a state’s gun statistics before and after background checks were implemented. In 1995, the state of Connecticut encouraged a law that required all gun buyers to take a test, essentially a background check, to receive a purchasing permit.  This resulted in a decrease of 40% of the state’s gun crime and 15% fewer rate of suicide (Stuart et al., 19). In contrast, research was conducted by Daniel Webster et al., on the state of Missouri which had decimated its law requiring the ownership of a permit to acquire a weapon in 2007.  Missouri’s homicide rate spiked by 23% and its gun related suicides increased by 16% (Webster et al., 19). A certain question comes in mind when reviewing this data; what about the data of all other states? In several states, background checks had virtually no positive or negative effects on crime rate. This inconsistency and lack of statistics is due to the federal government’s failure to provide adequate funds for decent studies (Kurtzleben).  Overtime, this can lead to the biased problems we experience today. Democrats don’t have sufficient evidence to support their agenda, often losing seats and money, while Republicans use the lack of data in their favor to counter more laws because they are deemed unviable.
</h3></p>
	<p><h3> Republicans are routinely met with backlash over their opposition on increasing gun control.  As mentioned by Harry Cheadle of Vice, close to 80% of voting Americans are for more and improved gun laws to help seize violence in the country. Expanding background checks and enforcing them throughout every state would stop violent criminal offenders, the mentally ill, and domestic abusers from purchasing firearms (Cheadle). More specifically, Cheadle is speaking on all the recent mass shooting tragedies that have happened in recent times. Sandy Hooks School Shooting, Las Vegas Massacre, and the more recent Church shooting that occurred at a Texas Baptist Church, are all gun related tragedies that could have virtually been prevented. Conservatives would most likely challenge this claim by providing supporting evidence that many of these mass murders passed their background checks, and many of them because government agencies had not updated their criminal databases (Kestler-D’Amours). Advocates for gun control keep reverting to one key point; lofty standards for prosecution.  In the article, “Why even the gun laws that exist don’t always get enforced,” Sarah Trumble, Senior Policy Counselor during Barrack Obama’s presidency, is quoted as saying:
It is true that gun laws are vastly under-enforced, but the reason that they're under-enforced is not because the administration or law enforcement has failed: It's because they're written in a way that makes them impossible to enforce – intentionally. They're too vague to prosecute, the standards are too high to meet, the penalties are too low to be a deterrent and there's too little evidence to prosecute.
This reasoning can be used to explain data I presented by the Americans for Gun Safety Foundation; the prosecutions required to decrease black market gun trafficking and gun violence are near to impossible to achieve.
