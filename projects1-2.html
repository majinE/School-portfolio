      <p><center>Analysis of my Primary Discourse</p>
	<p>Discourse communities define the identity of a human being through language, actions, and reactions that are exclusively gained from a form of training.  Every human is born into a primary discourse and can willingly be indoctrinated into any genre of secondary discourse.  They are the motives for the nature of our personality.  Linguist John Swales elaborates on six characteristics that produce the framework for the success of a discourse.  In his analysis, he claims that their feat derives from: common goals, communication, contributions, unique characteristics, possible changes in membership, and reasons to support the success of the coached discourses.  We often associate secondary discourses with the cause of our personalities, but the primary discourse influences our decisions in choosing and participating in a secondary discourse.  In my case, my family is my primary discourse, therefore it impacts my personality the most.
</p>
	<p><h3>“A discourse community has a broadly agreed set of common public goals.” (Swales 471) Usually these goals are agreed implicitly in primary discourses while secondary communities, like a job, classroom, or organization, tend to have written goals; resembled by rules and values they hope to carry out.    Swales states that these goals are public because non-members have the capability to join any form of discourse.   My primary discourse teaches younger members common goals such as supporting and helping one another, while the older members goals are customarily to try and keep the family together through thick and thin.  They are usually the ones in charge of passing down these goals and traditions in attempt to keep our discourse advancing throughout future generations.  Family members or friends can join and stay to sabotage our community or to help increase our advancement.</h3></p>
	<p><h3>“A discourse community has mechanisms of intercommunication among its members.” (Swales) Successful discourses require a form of communications or various forms.  Present-day primary discourses, as do secondary discourses, incline to using electronic forms of communications.  Writing letters and using the postal service has evolved into instantaneous electronic mail.  Many Job discourses have converted into using skype and zoom business calls for interviews, meetings and more, instead of hosting these events in person.  Phone calls and group text messages has become the primary source of communication within my primary discourse.  This allows us to stay-up-to-date with any family business.  Though technology has been a changing factor within our family’s communication mechanisms, traditional family gatherings and events occur within our discourse.</h3></p>
